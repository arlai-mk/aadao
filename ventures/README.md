## Why Venture Deals?

1. Ecosystem Growth and Innovation: Venture grants provide financial support to early-stage builders and entrepreneurs, encouraging them to innovate and develop new projects within the Cosmos ecosystem. This funding can catalyze the creation of novel applications, protocols, and services that leverage the capabilities of the Cosmos Hub and contribute to its overall growth.
‍

2. Diversification of Offerings: While the Cosmos Hub already provides security and liquidity services, venture grants offer an additional avenue for diversification. By investing in a broad range of projects, the Cosmos Hub can expand its ecosystem beyond its core offerings and explore new opportunities for value creation, the end result being a more robust and vibrant AEZ.
‍

3. Strategic Alignment with Cosmos Agenda: Venture grants can be used to support projects that align closely with the goals and priorities of the Cosmos Hub and the broader ATOM growth plan. This ensures that funding is directed towards initiatives that contribute to the long-term vision and sustainability of the Cosmos ecosystem.
‍

4. Community Empowerment: Venture grants empower the Cosmos community to play an active role in shaping the future of the ecosystem. By providing funding to community-driven projects, the Cosmos Hub fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration among its stakeholders, leading to a more vibrant and inclusive ecosystem. Additionally, Cosmos Hub stakers will have the opportunity to have a voice in the governance of other chains.
‍

5. Leveraging Treasury Assets: The Cosmos Hub's treasury, which consists of a significant amount of digital assets, can be leveraged to fund venture grants. By allocating a portion of these assets toward supporting promising projects, the Cosmos Hub can maximize the impact of its resources and drive meaningful growth and innovation within the ecosystem.
‍

6. Alignment with Security and Liquidity Objectives: Venture grants can complement the Cosmos Hub's security and liquidity initiatives by supporting projects that enhance interoperability, liquidity provision, and security infrastructure within the ecosystem. This holistic approach ensures that the Cosmos Hub remains competitive and resilient in the evolving blockchain landscape.
