# [Atom Accelerator DAO (AADAO)](https://www.atomaccelerator.com/)

## Introduction

This repository serves as an unofficial yet comprehensive archive for the Atom Accelerator DAO's key activities, operations, and oversight mechanisms. It contains detailed historic information regarding the DAO's mandate, organizational structure, and funding categories, as well as records of contributors and grantees.

Additionally, this repository provides an overview of the Oversight Committee, including its composition, authority, and related activities. This ensures a transparent and accountable framework within the DAO, fostering trust and integrity in its governance and operational processes.

## Background

Following the contentious rejection of signaling Proposal [#82: ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/82), the Cosmos Hub subsequently passed Proposal [#88: Increase the Community Pool Tax on the Cosmos Hub - Parameter Change](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/88). Proposal #88 raised the community tax rate from 2% to 10%, with the stated objective of increasing inflows to the community pool to "support future funding initiatives that bring utility to the Cosmos Hub."

In this context of governance fatigue and increased community pool funds, the Atom Accelerator DAO (AADAO) was proposed and established via Proposal [#95: A Grant Program for the Cosmos Hub: Funding the ATOM Accelerator DAO](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/95). Proposal #95, submitted as a community spend proposal, sought to create an inaugural mandate for the Atom Accelerator DAO (AADAO). This proposal successfully secured funding of 588,000 ATOM for the "ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program." 

Having completed its pilot phase through Proposal #95, ATOM Accelerator DAO aimed to soldify its role as a strategic allocator of resources to drive innovation and development on the Cosmos Hub. 
On December 16th, 2023 Proposal [#865: Funding ATOM Accelerator DAO (AADAO) renewal proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/865/) went live on chain, the proposal sought 975,811 ATOM in funding for the next chapter, which included a bonus allocation of 100,000 ATOM. The renewal proposal #865 was passed on December 30th, 2023, which secured an increase in 65.95% ATOM from the previous year.  

## Team & Structure
The DAO is split into two teams: the core DAO and the oversight committee. 
Together the core members are responsible for program setup, review of proposals, interviewing of applicants, distribution of grants, and multisignature operations. 

The oversight committee is responsible for ensuring the DAO operates efficiently and in the best interest of the Cosmos Hub by implementing policies and procedures, transparency reporting, and having oversight of internal operations.
Oversight also has veto power to discontinue grants, and dismiss part-time/full-time contributors in the event of substantiated performance issues or severe misconduct.

## [`Grantees`](https://github.com/gaiaus/aadao)

Grantees are individuals, organizations, or entities that receive funds, resources, or support from a grantor (such as a foundation, government agency, DAO, or other funding bodies) under the terms of a grant agreement. Grantees are typically required to use the funds or resources for specific purposes outlined in the grant agreement, and they often must report on their progress and outcomes to ensure compliance with the grant's objectives and requirements.
