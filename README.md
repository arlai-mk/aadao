## Background

Following the contentious rejection of signaling Proposal [#82: ATOM 2.0: A new vision for Cosmos Hub](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/82).

The Cosmos Hub subsequently passed Proposal [#88: Increase the Community Pool Tax on the Cosmos Hub - Parameter Change](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/88). Proposal #88 raised the community tax rate from 2% to 10%, with the stated objective of increasing inflows to the community pool to support future funding initiatives that bring utility to the Cosmos Hub.

In this context of governance fatigue and augmented community pool funds, the Atom Accelerator DAO was proposed and established via Proposal [#95.A Grant Program for the Cosmos Hub: Funding the ATOM Accelerator DAO](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/95). Proposal #95, submitted as a community spend proposal, sought to create an inaugural mandate for the Atom Accelerator DAO (AADAO). This proposal successfully secured funding of 588,000 ATOMs for the "ATOM Accelerator DAO Grant Program."

This initiative aimed to strategically allocate resources to drive innovation and development within the Cosmos Hub, thereby addressing governance challenges and maximizing the utility derived from community funds.
