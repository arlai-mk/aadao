# Grantees

Grantees are individuals, organizations, or entities that receive funds, resources, or support from a grantor (such as a foundation, government agency, DAO, or other funding bodies) under the terms of a grant agreement. Grantees are typically required to use the funds or resources for specific purposes outlined in the grant agreement, and they often must report on their progress and outcomes to ensure compliance with the grant's objectives and requirements.
