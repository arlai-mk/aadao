* **Piloting deliberative governance for the Cosmos**: Pilot research program aimed to address and improve governance challenges Cosmos hub faces today. Grant was discontinued six weeks subsequent to the initial payment disbursement. The reason for discontinuation, as per announcement in [Transparency Report #4](https://medium.com/@atomaccelerator/atom-accelerator-dao-transparency-report-4-ff80e895ee1e): "AADAO has decided to discontinue its funding for the Mission Publiques/RnDAO led project ‘Cosmozens Research Pilot Program’. The project team was unable to complete the milestone related to publishing its methodolgy to select participants into sortitions in a reasonable timeframe, and there was a general lack of community support, which were both factors."  Prior to their application to AADAO, the Grantees previously sought funding from Cosmos Hub community pool: ["After the Big Bang: A Constitutional Process for the Cosmos Hub", Cosmos Hub Forum Post, Antoine Vergne](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-after-the-big-bang-a-constitutional-process-the-cosmos-hub/8695), and via Proposal [#90: Community Health research, analytics, and benchmarking](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/90/). Proposal #90 was rejected.

The final milestone includes the creation of a website that showcases the capabilities of the indexer technology. This website features real-time tracking of proposal votes, detailed analysis of voting data, and displays voter voting power. Inspired by discussions in the AADAO space, the project has also produced a polished presentation and comprehensive documentation. The final payment was made May 2024, and "is justified by the completion of all grant work, the innovative features of the governance monitoring website, and the alignment of the project with the grant objectives, demonstrating significant potential for enhancing transparency and understanding of governance activities within the Cosmos community."

* **Cosmos Hub Hackathon**: DoraHacks is a global hacker movement and the world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer incentive platform. More than 3,000 projects from the DoraHacks community have received over $30 million in grants and hackathon prizes. DoraHacks.io has around 250,000 active users worldwide. The platform offers hackathons, bounties, quadratic funding, privacy voting, and other community governance/funding toolkits. In addition, over 100 major Web3 ecosystems are currently using Dora infrastructures to fund their open-source communities. The Cosmos Hub Hackathon aims to align all stakeholders by incentivizing individuals and organizations to explore and develop their ideas on Cosmos Hub by offering individuals and organizations non-dilutive funding to develop and further the Atom ecosystem.
  
* **New DAO Bootstrapping**: AADAO grant will bootstrap Sun DAO with initial funding to become a Cosmos Investment DAO with a special focus on AEZ. In addition to the early financial bootstrapping, AADAO will also provide Sun DAO with strategic and operational support as well as knowledge transfer.  

* **Interchain Info Development Funding**: Completed milestones include:
  * Design and functionality for AEZ portal page
  * AEZ news articles 
  * Initial work on the [Interchain Academy](https://interchaininfo.zone/) 

* **Fiat Onboarding to the ATOM Economic Zone**: Kado is looking to partner with the ATOM Accelerator to provide direct fiat on and off-ramp services for the ATOM Economic Zone (AEZ). Kado envisions a long-term partnership with the AEZ by exploring and collaborating on various infrastructure, fiat, and payments use cases in the future. The goal of this grant is to enable a flourishing AEZ ecosystem and drive value accrual for ATOM. Streamlining the user/capital onboarding process directly to Consumer Chain applications is a requirement to drive activity and value back to the Hub. More users, more capital onboarded, and more AEZ onchain activity; also leads to more builders wanting to build on the AEZ and the flywheel continues. On top of this, as ATOM potentially becomes the gas token of the AEZ, users will need the ability to easily/instantly top up their wallet with more ATOM (from fiat) - creating more buying pressure for ATOM. 
  
* **AEZ Ecosystem Build Out References**: This grant provides bridge funding to bring Shogun's Decentralized Interchain Market Maker (DIMM) to mainnet in the AEZ. DIMM aggregates and optimizes orderflow, granting traders in the AEZ "the best execution available in the ecosystem, generating ATOM-denominated revenue for LPs and increasing tx fee revenue to ATOM stakers." The protocol contains 3 components:
 
    * P2P order-matching engine (CoW); 
    * JIT LP vaults that conduct dynamic rebalancing–white listed asset pairs such as ATOM/USDC as vault pools that enhance IL protection for boost capital efficiency for LPs
    * Smart Order Routing: use existing liquidity pools across the interchain to settle residual orders which are not filled in the P2P matching engine or JIT LP vaults

The combination of the 3 components provide the best trading execution for traders measured by lowest slippage, price impact, and mitigation of harmful MEV. The JIT LP vaults enhance capital efficiency and protect from unnecessary IL based on the risk threshold set by the vault.
  
* **Astrovault+**: Astrovault is a proprietary model hybrid AMM built entirely from the ground up. Their DEX incorporates slippage-free 1:1 trades alongside the traditional AMM model, and utilizes staking derivatives as base trading pairs. The Astrovault team would like to build out an SDK to enable all Comsos apps to earn from their own liquidity. For more, please see their economic research, available in [Section 6 of their Whitepaper](https://docs.astrovault.io/axv-whitepaper.pdf#page=11). Grant goals include deployment of Astrovault on Neutron.   
  
* **GT:1 Automated Grant Payments/Treasury Tooling**: Grantee Team is Calculated.fi. The grant aims to produce a tool that enables:
  * Community pool vesting + streaming of payments to DAOs & Contributors
  * Tooling to enable payout of ATOM (or other assets) from the community pool (or the treasuries) in USD terms as well as allowing split funding types in a proposal across set-up and streaming. 
  
* **Cosmos Hub & AEZ Educational Content**: "Cosmos Joe" to create educational content that generates "positive narrative for the Cosmos Hub, AEZ, ICS & consumer chains."  Deliverables include following:
    * easy to follow tutorials for application use & other on-chain actions related to the Cosmos Hub.
    * informative YouTube interviews with willing founders, devs & other key figures that are building out the Atom Economic Zone, ICS or other valuable products related to the Hub.
    * utilize creator's "existing DeFi 101 & NFT Happy Hour platforms to bring on guests that are building out the Atom Economic Zone, ICS, or other valuable products related to the Hub
    * produce interactive videos that will allow engaged audience members to demonstrate understanding of the concepts covered in my content (using Omniflix)
    * reward audience members for their engagement (using proof-of-participation NFTs)
    * repurpose informational content into easily digestible clips, threads, infographics or articles
  
* **Polymer Labs IBC Summit**: Talks, workshops, panels, and hackathons bringing together the brightest minds building on Inter-Blockchain Communication.

* **Testnet Working Group**: Hypha Co-op runs the Replicated Security testnet for the Cosmos Hub, which allows consumer chain teams and mainnet Hub validators gain familiarity with Replicated Security technology and social norms. The RS testnet is currently supported by ~40 validators and has included as many as 90 during critical launch rehearsals. The testnet working group brings together the testnet program coordinators (Hypha) and mainnet validators to smooth the onboarding process of new consumer chains into the Hub’s replicated security. For a 6 month pilot period, the testnet working group is granted $50k USD to incentivize mainnet Hub validators to:

  * Reliably participate on the Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet using their mainnet setups, to properly replicate the mainnet environment.

  * Take on the responsibility of validating the testnet with larger stake distribution, which further decentralizes the testnet and gives validators better opportunities to participate more in testing. 

  * Provide feedback to consumer chain teams and Hub development teams based on their expertise and experience with testing features on testnet.

  * Help other validators join the testnet and operate at a level that would let them join the testnet working group.
