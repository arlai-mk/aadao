Grant recipients are employees at Binary Builders and Informal Systems. Grant allocation is disbursed to devs directly as indepedent contractors (there is no payment or involvment from grantees' employers). 

* **Piloting deliberative governance for the Cosmos**: Pilot research program aimed to address and improve governance challenges Cosmos hub faces today. Grant was discontinued six weeks subsequent to the initial payment disbursement. The reason for discontinuation, as per announcement in [Transparency Report #4](https://medium.com/@atomaccelerator/atom-accelerator-dao-transparency-report-4-ff80e895ee1e): "AADAO has decided to discontinue its funding for the Mission Publiques/RnDAO led project ‘Cosmozens Research Pilot Program’. The project team was unable to complete the milestone related to publishing its methodolgy to select participants into sortitions in a reasonable timeframe, and there was a general lack of community support, which were both factors."  Prior to their application to AADAO, the Grantees previously sought funding from Cosmos Hub community pool: ["After the Big Bang: A Constitutional Process for the Cosmos Hub", Cosmos Hub Forum Post, Antoine Vergne](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-after-the-big-bang-a-constitutional-process-the-cosmos-hub/8695), and via Proposal [#90: Community Health research, analytics, and benchmarking](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/90/). Proposal #90 was rejected.

* New DAO bootstrapping: ?
  
* Interchain Info Development Funding w/ AEZ chain priority: ?
  
* Fiat Onboarding to the ATOM Economic Zone: Kado is looking to partner with the ATOM Accelerator to provide direct fiat on and off-ramp services for the ATOM Economic Zone (AEZ). Kado envisions a long-term partnership with the AEZ by exploring and collaborating on various infrastructure, fiat, and payments use cases in the future. The goal of this grant is to enable a flourishing AEZ ecosystem and drive value accrual for ATOM. Streamlining the user/capital onboarding process directly to Consumer Chain applications is a requirement to drive activity and value back to the Hub. More users, more capital onboarded, and more AEZ onchain activity; also leads to more builders wanting to build on the AEZ and the flywheel continues. On top of this, as ATOM potentially becomes the gas token of the AEZ, users will need the ability to easily/instantly top up their wallet with more ATOM (from fiat) - creating more buying pressure for ATOM.
