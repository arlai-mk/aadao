* **Cosmoverse 2024**: Cosmoverse is the single largest conference for the entire Cosmos ecosystem, with its 2024 event aiming to attract over 2000 attendees. The grant will promote the Cosmos Hub, its technology and innovation, and the AEZ projects that are driving value to the Hub — before, after, and at the conference.

* **Asteroid Protocol**: Establish the Cosmos Hub as a permanent data storage layer, facilitating DeFi activities like minting and swapping NFTs and fungible tokens. The grant’s goals include integrating advanced functionality in NFT and CFT20 marketplaces — from the ability to launch NFT collections to floor-sweeping functionality; expanding interoperability through cross-chain transfers of NFTs and CFT20s; and introducing novel experiments to advance activity on the Hub.

* **"ATOM Value Accrual" Tracker, "Spelldrop"**: Everstake is developing an “Atom Value Accrual” tracker. This essential tool comprehensively illustrates and continuously tracks the growth in value derived from staking ATOM, alongside capturing all the airdrops ATOM stakers have qualified for. Everstake’s grant will include the delivery of API endpoints — allowing wallets, platforms and other UIs to access and make visible this data on other dashboards across Cosmos and other ecosystems. Currently, you can track up to 6 airdrops including Osmosis, Evmos, Neutron, Saga, Juno and Celestia: [spelldrop](https://spelldrop.xyz/)

* **Lava Network**: Lava Network’s incentivized Public RPC model aims to provide fast, reliable, and scalable access to the Cosmos Hub’s data. By consolidating several top RPC providers into a single endpoint, Lava ensures performant access to data, constant availability and cost efficiency for the user. Our grant to fund this critical public infrastructure will enable innovative dApps, dashboards and other use cases to flourish without being held back by unreliable RPC endpoints.
